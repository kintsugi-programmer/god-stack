> Reflections:

> [SPRINT-EDITION] Plan: 🔹 Sprint through the Neetcode 75 Quality list for practical In-Depth problem-solving. 🔹 Reinforce concepts with Neetcode's DSA Visualization course. 🔹 Level up with their Advanced DSA Course. 🔹 Sharpen my focus on interview-specific CS topics.

> Developer Pro Max is a 180-day journey to elite developer mastery. From Advanced DSA and Core CS to Full-Stack Web Development, DevOps, and System Design, this challenge is designed to build discipline, depth, and real-world skills. Every day is a step toward becoming a developer who doesn’t just code, but engineers systems, solves problems, and commands the full stack with confidence.

“Build like a mortal. Think like a god.”

> Resources: Abdul Bari's Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++, ChaiCode's Full Stack Web Dev Course with 100xDev's Cohort 3.0, NeetCode 250 DSA Sheet, and Research Docs &YT for Core CS , keeping focus on Revision, Health, Fitness & bit Gaming.
