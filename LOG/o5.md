> Reflections: - due to management of College Assignments & Classes + Career Prep. + Side Client's Works + Another Side Hustle ;I have decided to pivot the Challenge Plan into new Statergy Dominating DSA LEETC0DE Problem S0lving First then After New Year, Master FULLSTACK WEBDEV.
- due to emerging importance of dsa>dev in interviews
- after some hit-n-trials i found out this to be more efficient method
- need to Master Some Pre-Reqs Before Starting Long Endurance Race
- Now Plan

“Build like a mortal. Think like a god.”

> Developer Pro Max is a 180-day journey to elite developer mastery. From Advanced DSA and Core CS to Full-Stack Web Development, DevOps, and System Design, this challenge is designed to build discipline, depth, and real-world skills. Every day is a step toward becoming a developer who doesn’t just code, but engineers systems, solves problems, and commands the full stack with confidence.

> Resources: Abdul Bari's Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++, ChaiCode's Full Stack Web Dev Course with 100xDev's Cohort 3.0, NeetCode 250 DSA Sheet, Reinforce concepts with Neetcode's DSA Visualization course and Research Docs &YT for Core CS, Sharpen my focus on interview-specific CS topics, keeping focus on Revision, Health, Fitness & bit Gaming.
