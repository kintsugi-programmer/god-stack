# DEVELOPER_PRO_MAX
👾 Day x/180 of The DeveloperProMax Challenge 
- ⚙️ Build. Deploy. Dominate.
- 📚 Master DSA, LeetCode, Web Dev, DevOps, and Core CS (OS, CN, DBMS, OOP, SD). 

> Reflections: 

“Build like a mortal. Think like a god.”

> Developer Pro Max is a 180-day journey to elite developer mastery. From Advanced DSA and Core CS to Full-Stack Web Development, DevOps, and System Design, this challenge is designed to build discipline, depth, and real-world skills. Every day is a step toward becoming a developer who doesn’t just code, but engineers systems, solves problems, and commands the full stack with confidence.

> Resources: Abdul Bari's Mastering Data Structures & Algorithms using C and C++, ChaiCode's Full Stack Web Dev Course with 100xDev's Cohort 3.0, NeetCode 250 DSA Sheet, Reinforce concepts with Neetcode's DSA Visualization course and Research Docs &YT for Core CS, Sharpen my focus on interview-specific CS topics, keeping focus on Revision, Health, Fitness & bit Gaming.

The [god-stack](https://github.com/kintsugi-programmer/god-stack) repository, authored by Kintsugi-Programmer, is less a comprehensive resource and more an Artifact of Continuous Research and Deep Inquiry into Computer Science and Software Engineering. It serves as a transparent ledger of the author's relentless pursuit of mastery, from the foundational algorithms to modern full-stack implementation.
