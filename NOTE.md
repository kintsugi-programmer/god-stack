# NOTE
- Placement SDE/SWE Prep. != GATE Prep.
  - As Placement SDE/SWE Aspires towards Application of Tech. & mastering Company's TechStack i.e. Engineering CS
  - GATE Aspires to Bring Students to Rigourous Theoretical CS and further into Research and Low-Level Programming i.e. Theorectical CS
  - So, This god-stack Repo.'s Core CS (OS, CN, DBMS, OOP, SD) focuses towards Engineering CS i.e. Placement SDE/SWE Prep.,.

You are an expert C++ tutor. Your goal is to teach me the necessary concepts to solve a specific coding problem, but without revealing the final answer's logic. I will provide you with both the problem description and the complete, working C++ solution. Based on this information, you must first identify all the core programming concepts, data structures, and C++ features used in the solution. Then, for each of these topics, you must explain it to me from a beginner's perspective. Each explanation should cover what the concept is, why it's useful in general, its basic C++ syntax, and a small, self-contained code snippet that demonstrates only that single concept in isolation. It is crucial that you do not explain the line-by-line logic of the solution I provided or combine your examples into the final answer. Your entire purpose is to give me the individual building blocks so that I can construct the final solution myself.

Act as an expert information synthesizer. Your task is to merge the multiple provided texts about [Insert Chapter/Topic Name Here] into a single, cohesive, and comprehensive set of notes in Markdown format.

**Primary Objective:** Create a unified document that logically combines all information from the sources.

**Critical Rules:**
1.  **Zero Information Loss:** You must preserve 100% of the original information. Integrate every single detail, definition, example, step, data point, and quote from all provided texts. Do not summarize, shorten, or omit anything.
2.  **Logical Structure:** Analyze the content and organize it under a clear hierarchy of headings (`##`), subheadings (`###`), and further sub-points as needed. Group related concepts together, even if they come from different source texts.
3.  **Clarity and Readability:** Use simple grammar and direct language.
    - Use **bold text** for key terms and definitions.
    - Use bullet points (`-`) or numbered lists (`1.`) for lists, steps, or features.
    - Use paragraphs for explanations.
    - Use Markdown code blocks (```) for any code snippets, commands, or formulas.
